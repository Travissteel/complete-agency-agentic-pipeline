## Lead Generation Strategy

### Channel Priority (1-man agency focus)

#### 1. Warm Network Outreach (Week 1-2)
**Objective:** Secure first 3 clients from existing network

**Process:**
1. Create list of 50 contacts in target verticals
2. Send personalized message (template below)
3. Offer "Founder's Rate" discount (30% off first 3 months)
4. Goal: 10 discovery calls → 3 signed clients

**Message Template:**
```
Subject: Quick question about [their pain point]

Hey [Name],

I recently launched an AI automation studio focused specifically on [their vertical].

I've been building custom AI agents and automation pipelines that help businesses like yours [specific outcome - e.g., "qualify insurance leads 24/7" or "automate tenant screening"].

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to see if there's a fit? I'm offering founder's rates to my first 5 clients.

Best,
Travis
```

#### 2. LinkedIn Thought Leadership (Ongoing)
**Objective:** Build credibility and inbound interest

**Weekly Content Calendar:**
- **Monday:** Case study or client win (results-focused)
- **Wednesday:** Educational post (how AI solves specific problem)
- **Friday:** Industry insight or trend commentary

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Comment on 10 posts daily from target vertical leaders
- Share mini case studies (before/after screenshots)
- Use hashtags: #AIAutomation #CommercialInsurance #PropTech #RecruitmentTech

#### 3. Strategic Partnerships (Month 2+)
**Objective:** Leverage complementary service providers

**Partner Targets:**
- CRM consultants (HubSpot, Salesforce partners)
- Web design agencies (need backend automation)
- Business coaches serving target verticals
- Industry association memberships

**Partnership Pitch:**
```
I build custom AI automation for [vertical]. You handle [their service], I handle AI implementation. 20% referral fee both ways. Interested in exploring?
```

#### 4. Cold Outreach via Instantly (Month 3+)
**Objective:** Scale lead generation systematically

**Campaign Setup:**
- **List size:** 500 prospects per vertical
- **Daily send:** 50 emails (avoid spam filters)
- **Sequences:** 5 touchpoints over 14 days
- **Tracking:** Open rate, reply rate, meeting booked rate

**Cold Email Sequence:**

**Email 1 (Day 1):** Problem-aware opener
```
Subject: Are you still [doing manual task]?

[Name],

Most [vertical] firms I talk to are still [specific manual process] - which works, but takes 10-15 hours/week.

We just built an AI agent that handles this automatically (24/7, no human needed).

Curious if this is something you'd want to see in action?

- Travis
[Agency Name]
```

**Email 2 (Day 4):** Social proof
```
Subject: Re: Are you still [doing manual task]?

[Name],

I worked with [Similar Company] last month - they were spending 12 hours/week on [task].

Now it's automated. Their team focuses on revenue-generating work instead.

Want to see how it works? 15-min demo available this week.

- Travis
```

**Email 3 (Day 8):** Value-specific
```
Subject: Quick ROI math

[Name],

If your team spends 10 hours/week on [task] at $50/hour loaded cost, that's $26K/year.

Our automation costs $4K to build + $500/month to run.

ROI in 3 months. After that, pure savings.

Worth a conversation?

- Travis
```

**Email 4 (Day 11):** Break-up with offer
```
Subject: Last ping (+ free audit)

[Name],

I'll stop bugging you after this :)

If you're even slightly curious, I'll do a free 30-min process audit. No pitch, just identify your top 3 automation opportunities.

Calendly link: [your link]

Otherwise, best of luck!

- Travis
```

**Email 5 (Day 14):** Final value drop
```
Subject: One resource before I go

[Name],

Even if now's not the right time, here's a free resource I built:

[Link to lead magnet - e.g., "10 AI Automation Ideas for Insurance Agencies"]

Feel free to reach out when you're ready to automate.

Cheers,
Travis

## Discovery Call Script

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Objective:** Qualify prospect and identify high-value automation opportunities

### Pre-Call Preparation (5 mins)
- Research their website, LinkedIn, recent news
- Identify likely pain points based on vertical
- Prepare 3 relevant case studies/examples

### Call Structure

#### Opening (2 mins)
```
Thanks for making time, [Name].

Quick agenda: I'll ask you some questions about your current process, identify if AI automation is a fit, and if it is, we'll talk next steps. Sound good?

Before I dive in - what prompted you to take this call? What's the main challenge you're hoping to solve?
```

#### Discovery Questions (15 mins)

**Current State:**
1. "Walk me through your typical [process - e.g., lead intake workflow] from start to finish."
2. "How much time does your team spend on this weekly?"
3. "What tools/systems are you currently using?"
4. "Where do things typically break down or create bottlenecks?"

**Pain Points:**
5. "If you could wave a magic wand and automate one thing, what would it be?"
6. "What's the cost of NOT solving this? (lost revenue, missed opportunities, team burnout?)"
7. "Have you tried to automate this before? What happened?"

**Decision Criteria:**
8. "If we build something that solves this, what does success look like in 90 days?"
9. "Who else needs to be involved in the decision?"
10. "What's your timeline? Is this urgent or exploratory?"

#### Solution Presentation (8 mins)
```
Based on what you've shared, here's what I'd recommend:

[Describe specific automation - be concrete]

Example: "I'd build a custom AI agent that monitors your lead inbox 24/7, qualifies leads based on your criteria, and automatically schedules qualified prospects into your calendar. Unqualified leads get a polite auto-response."

This would save you [X hours/week] and ensure you never miss a hot lead outside business hours.

Implementation would take 2-3 weeks. Cost is [package tier] - $X to build, $Y/month to maintain.

Questions?
```

#### Closing (5 mins)

**If interested:**
```
Great! Next step is I'll send you a detailed proposal with scope, timeline, and pricing. I'll need about [1-2 days] to put that together.

In the meantime, can you send me:
- [Specific info needed - e.g., sample leads, current workflow docs]
- Access to [relevant tools - e.g., CRM, email platform]

I'll have the proposal to you by [specific date].
```

**If hesitant:**
```
No pressure at all. It sounds like timing might not be right, or maybe the ROI isn't clear yet.

Would it be helpful if I:
A) Send you a case study of similar work I did for [competitor/similar business]
B) Do a free process audit (30 mins, I just map out your automation opportunities)
C) Follow up in [30/60/90 days]

What feels right?
```

## Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:**
```
I totally get it. Let me ask - what's your current cost for [manual process]?

[Calculate hourly cost]

This automation pays for itself in [X months], then it's pure savings. Plus, you get 24/7 coverage you can't get with humans.

Would it help to start with just one workflow in the Starter package and prove ROI before expanding?
```

### "We're not ready for AI"
**Response:**
```
That's actually the perfect time to start. You don't need to understand AI - you just need to know your process is taking too long.

I handle all the technical stuff. From your end, it just works like any other software.

What if we started with a simple proof-of-concept? One small workflow, 2-week build, you see results before committing to anything bigger.
```

### "We tried automation before and it didn't work"
**Response:**
```
I hear that a lot. What happened?

[Listen]

The difference with custom AI is it's built specifically for YOUR process, not a one-size-fits-all tool. And it gets smarter over time.

What if I do a free audit of your current setup and show you exactly what went wrong and how we'd fix it?
```

### "I need to think about it"
**Response:**
```
Of course. Can I ask what specifically you need to think through?

[Listen, address concerns]

Would it help if I sent you:
- A case study from [similar business]
- ROI calculator so you can run your own numbers
- References from current clients

What information would make this an easier decision?
```

### "Can you do it cheaper?"
**Response:**
```
I appreciate you asking. My pricing reflects the custom nature of the work - this isn't a template, it's built specifically for your business.

That said, I can work within your budget. What if we:
- Start with the highest-impact workflow first (phased approach)
- Do a 3-month pilot at a reduced rate to prove ROI
- Explore a longer-term contract with volume discounts

What's your budget target?
```
